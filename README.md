GPS - Allows for user to see the closest centers to their location and details on those centers, allowing for easy direction


### How to run

You will need android studio on your computer in order to run our project. We also recommend running with an android device instead of the emulator. 

1. Open our project in android studio
2. Sync our gradle files (this might take a while because we are using two apis, one from tomtom and the other is MLKit from google)
3. Once the sync is complete build and run the project (if you are using an emulator you will have to configure your location and the camera)
